         How to play online from India
      Ever wished you could play a big international lottery like Powerball, Mega Millions, and EuroMillions? Now you can play these incredible games online from India. American lotteries are not subject to Indian gambling restrictions, so you can play from anywhere in the country on your computer or phone. You'll have the chance to win jackpots that are much larger than the Indian lottery top prizes.

      Playing the lottery online is simple, so don't worry if you haven't bought a ticket online or used a lottery concierge service before. Just follow these steps to get started:
<!-- card ito -->
      Click on any of the banners or Play Now   buttons on Lotto.in.
      Choose the lottery you wish to play
      Select your numbers manually by using the number selector grid or generate a random set of numbers using the Quick Pick button.
      Click the Continue button to confirm your purchase.
      Enter your details to open your account, or register a new account, and complete your purchase.
      After receiving your order, you can view your numbers in your online account.

      <!-- card end ito  -->
      If you win a prize, you'll receive a text/SMS or email to the email address provided when you registered your account. You can also view the results for each lottery on the lottery pages shortly after each draw has taken place.
