            A new Kerala state lottery called Bhagyamithra is scheduled to launch in the middle of October, with draws taking place on the first Sunday of every month. At Rs 100 per ticket this is a great chance to win one of the five first prizes of Rs 1 crore each!

            40 lakh tickets will be issued for the inaugural draw, which will take place on the 1st November. Prizes include the five main prizes of Rs 1 crore, one second prize of Rs 10 lakh, and eight third place prizes of Rs 2 lakh. 35 consolation prizes of Rs 25,000 can also be won. Other prizes will include Rs 5,000, Rs 2,000, Rs 1,000, Rs 500 and Rs 300.

            This lottery will help create revenue lost with the cancellation of the Pournami Sunday Lottery, not to mention helping lottery agents whose ticket sales have collapsed due to the effects of the Corona virus forcing weekly lotteries to be dropped from seven to three. This new lottery is a good step in the right direction and a perfect chance to win big cash prizes.

            First prize: 5 x Rs  1 crore

            Second prize: Rs 10 lakh

            Third prize: 8 x Rs 2 lakh each

            Total number of prizes: Rs 2,05,969
